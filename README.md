# ClassProject4
This Is a script I made for a class project. 
It was made in all of two days so it definately could be better.
Please be gentle with suggestions if you have any. 

What it is/does:
This is a bash script made to run in a git bash terminal on a windows machine that finds and backs up steam game saves. 
It also goes out to the Steam Web API to find the name of said games so that they are displayed in a human readable format. 

Searches Steam's Userdata folder, and windows' MyDocs MyGames folder. 

I commented the heck out of it so it should be easy to follow if you want to take a look at it. 

Version 1 does not support multiple Steam IDs.
